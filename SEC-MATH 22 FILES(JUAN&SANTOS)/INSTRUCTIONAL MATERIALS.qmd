# Grade 9 Geometry

## Quarter 3 – Module 3 (Proportion and Triangle Similarity)

### Lesson 4: Theorems on Similarity of Triangles by Proportion

• Triangle Proportionality Theorem

• Tranversal Proportionality Theorem

• Triangle Angle Bisector Theorem

#### What I Need to Know

At the end of this lesson, you are expected to: solve and apply theorems on similarity of triangles using:

• Triangle Proportionality Theorem;

• Transversal Proportionality Theorem; and

• Triangle Angle Bisector Theorem.

#### What’s In

**Instructions:** Identify which of the following figures shows parallel lines or congruent angles. Write **Yes** if it is and **No** when it is not.

#### What’s New

In this lesson, it is very important to identify the parallel lines and congruent angles in a triangle . In order to solve the problem, apply the following theorems on similar triangles by proportion. Below are some of the theorems that you need to know.

#### What Is It

Below are examples of the theorems on similarity of triangles by proportion.

As you have observed, examples 3, 4, and 5 have the same given; however, the proportionality or formula used are different from each other. Therefore, even though transversal proportionality theorem have three possible proportionality or formula, you only have to choose one that suits the proportionality problem to be solved.

#### What I Need To Remember

**A. TRIANGLE PROPORTIONALITY THEOREM**

If a line parallel to one side of a triangle intersects the other two sides of the triangle, then the line divides these two sides proportionally.

**B. TRANSVERSAL PROPORTIONALITY THEOREM**

If three or more parallel lines are cut by two transversals, then they divide the transversals proportionally.

**C. TRIANGLE ANGLE BISECTOR THEOREM**

An angle bisector of an angle of a triangle divides the opposite side in two segments that are proportional to the other two sides of the triangle.
