## The Pythagorean Theorem

The Pythagorean Theorem is one of the earliest theorems known to ancient civilizations. This famous theorem is named after the Greek mathematician and philosopher, Pythagoras.

## THE PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM

The Pythagorean Theorem is a statement about right triangles. The Pythagorean Theorem states that: “The area of the square built upon the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares upon the remaining sides.”

## Additional Activities

Directions: Consider the given situation and answer the questions that follow. Use your knowledge of the Pythagorean Theorem. The heights of the two buildings are 41 m and 32 m and they are 12 m apart. A man went to the rooftop of the shorter building and wondered looking at the roof top of the taller building.
